                        I moved to Canada in 2016, and before that, I had never written a single line
                        of code. I’m so grateful to the teachers who sparked my interest in programming. Since then, I’ve been
                        dabbling with code whenever I get the chance. I’m fully committed to the journey of continuous learning
                        that this field requires, and honestly, I’m loving every minute of it.

                        I consider myself a full-stack developer, but I've worked in many different fields over the years.
                        From backend and frontend to network-level programming and messaging brokers, I've seen a fair 
                        chunk of the sofware world! Feel free to take a look at some of the projects I’ve worked on!
